/**
 * Harness browser sessions, one per host.
 *
 * Harness 0.1.2 answers 401 to every `/api` request without one, so a direct connection cannot do
 * anything at all until this store holds a cookie for that host. The cookie is obtained once, by
 * exchanging the launch token the harness prints at startup, and survives harness restarts — the
 * signing secret is durable upstream even though the token itself rotates.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* encrypted at rest, unlike [RelayCredentialStore]. That store guards a relay
 * device token, which is a credential for reaching a machine across a network. This one guards a
 * session that the far end issued to this handset for its own use — obtained either from a harness
 * reached directly, over `adb reverse` or on the device itself, or from a `dsh-pocket` proxy that
 * hands the same cookie to any browser that reaches its origin. On both paths anything able to read
 * this app's DataStore is already running as the user whose harness it is, and neither cookie is a
 * credential for a machine belonging to somebody else. Encrypting it would suggest a boundary that
 * is not there.
 *
 * Behind a relay this store stays empty: the relay holds the harness session and injects it
 * upstream, and the phone never carries the host's cookie across the network.
